What is Trafa?
--
Trafa is a mobile application using AI that can identify traditional fabrics using a smartphone camera and gives the meaning of each motif from traditional fabrics in Indonesia

Summary
--
Indonesia has a very fascinating variety of cultures, one of which is the diversity of traditional fabrics. Each region has traditional fabrics that are used for customary purposes and contain motifs, patterns, and colors with deep meanings, philosophies, and stories that have been passed down from generation to generation.

Many people are still unaware of the meaning and philosophy of each traditional fabric. If this trend continues, the community will lose their identity and the value of cultural arts in every region in Indonesia will decrease. With advances in technology, knowledge of traditional fabric culture should increase so that people can love and be proud of this culture, and the preservation of this culture can continue for the next generation. 

We propose the idea of an application designed using ML, which can help people detect types of traditional fabrics and provide relevant information regarding the description of traditional fabrics. This can foster a sense of love for the cultural heritage that we have, as our tagline says: “aku cinta kain kita”.
